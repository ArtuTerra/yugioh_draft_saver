# Yugioh Chaos Draft Saver!

This small bit of code was created to help me save my drafted cards(on ygoprodeck pack simulator) in case the website happens to get stuck loading the next pack indefinitely.

## How to use:

- Use "Inspect element" on the draft page
- Write down: "chaosdraftarray" in the console
- Copy the resulting array as an object
- Create a new "input.txt" file in the program folder and paste the array into the text file.
- Run the program using Node js
- The code will create a .csv file which you can import directly into your ygoProDeck Collection!

Known bugs: Cards with a " , " in them have issues being converted to CSV.
